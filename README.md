# Villager Memory Tweaks
A mod that makes sure villagers find a job in their village, and also find their villages meeting point
interact with a villager to "fix" a village

giving a villager the "vmt_fixed" scoreboard tag will make them not be able to initiate a fix, but if they do not have a profession this will still be set for them if a fix is initiated via another villager.
